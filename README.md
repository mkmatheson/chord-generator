# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

// IMPORTANT: there will be two versions:
// 1: you write the chord based on the scale degree in a key (the V of Cmaj)
// 2: you write the chord based on the chord root note and quality (Cmaj7)

// todo: have "favor enharmonics as flats or sharps"
// todo: modes?
// todo: generate chord according to scale (i.e. diminished should only appear for vii)
// todo: consider non-mode dependance
// todo: account for harmonic min raised seventh
// const modes = ["ionian", "aeolian"]

// todo: add sounds

// todo: chain chords into measures

// todo: auto-generate new chords ever x seconds with tempo and measure

todo: style and dark mode
